# Test Plan
  In this module we are going to discuss about two tests plan which are given below-
 (A). Basic Operational Test Case
 (B). Functionality Test Case
## 1. Basic Operational Test Cases

   | BOTC_8 | Check if the square key is working or not.                            |  Yes   |
   | BOTC_9 | Check if all the numbers (0 to 9) are working or not                  |  Yes   |
   | BOTC_10| Check if the backets keys are working or not                          |  Yes   |
   | BOTC_11| Check if sum and equal key is working or not                          |  Yes   |
   | BOTC_12| Check if clear key is working or not                                  |  Yes   |
   | BOTC_13| Check if exit option is working or not                                |  Yes   |

   | FTC_3  | Check if the arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /, %,) are working or not. |  Yes   |
   | FTC_4  | Check if the square key is working or not.                            |  Yes   |
   | FTC_5  | Check if all the numbers (0 to 9) are working or not                  |  Yes   |
   | FTC_6  | Check if the backets keys are working or not                          |  Yes   |
   | FTC_7  | Check if sum and equal key is working or not                          |  Yes   |
   | FTC_8  | Check if clear key is working or not                                  |  Yes   |
   | FTC_9  | Check if exit option is working or not                                |  Yes   |
