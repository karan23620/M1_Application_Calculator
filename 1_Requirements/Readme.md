# Requirements
  This Calculator required few keys to perform action according to user choice which are given below-
   - digits - 0-9.
   - some operators for performing operation like "+, -, *, /, ^, !".
   - Press 'Q' or 'q' to quit the program.
   - Press 'H' or 'h' for asking to clear screen then press 'C' or 'c' .

## Introduction

  This is very simple calculator. Iâ€™m going to create this simple calculator using C programming. So this calculator performs few operation such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power and factorial. So I create this calculator program in two ways 
  - Using switch case
  - Using Function

## Features
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Modulus
  - Power
  - Factorial
  
  on the basis of above option user can choose their requirements and get awesome result in few seconds.
  
 ## State of art/Research
 An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
 
The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom.

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools

But my calculator is very simple and perform very few tasks and its also not look like electronic or modern electronic calculators. So below you can see some steps to perfom any mathematical tasks-

Step 1: Print the Choice (Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

Step 2: Enter the Choice.

Step 3: Takes two numbers, n1 and n2

Step 4: Switch case jump to an operator selected by the user

Step 5: Store result into res variable.

Step 6: Display the operation result

Step 7: Exit from the program.
