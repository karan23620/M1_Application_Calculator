# Requirements
  This Calculator required few keys to perform action according to user choice which are given below-
   - digits - 0-9.
   - some operators for performing operation like "+, -, *, /, ^, !".
   - Press 'Q' or 'q' to quit the program.
   - Press 'H' or 'h' for asking to clear screen then press 'C' or 'c' .

## Introduction

  This is very simple calculator. I’m going to create this simple calculator using C programming. So this calculator performs few operation such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power and factorial. So I create this calculator program in two ways 
  - Using switch case
  - Using Function

## Features
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Modulus
  - Power
  - Factorial
  
  on the basis of above option user can choose their requirements and get awesome result in few seconds.
  
 ## State of art/Research
 An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
 
The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom.

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools

But my calculator is very simple and perform very few tasks and its also not look like electronic or modern electronic calculators. So below you can see some steps to perfom any mathematical tasks-

Step 1: Print the Choice (Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

Step 2: Enter the Choice.

Step 3: Takes two numbers, n1 and n2

Step 4: Switch case jump to an operator selected by the user

Step 5: Store result into res variable.

Step 6: Display the operation result

Step 7: Exit from the program.

## 4W's 1-H
### Why
  - It reduce the complexity of solving mathematical problem.
  - I’m making this calculator for human to reduce their mistake in mathematical calculation.
  - It can be used by anyone.
### Where
  - IT can be used in our daily life mathematical problems any where.
  - It is mostly used by humans in study, in shop, in exam etc.
### Who
  - It can be used by anyone.
  - Basically it is frequently used by student, teacher, shopkeeper etc.
### When
  - It can be used any time and any where.
  - It can used for most mathematical calculations.
### How
  - It can used by few steps. 
  - First choose the operation you want to do. 
  - Then type numbers and then hit enter. 
  - you will get the desirable output.Thats it, so simple.

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
  - It is user friendly.
  - Easy to use.
  - Save time while doing mathematical problem.
  - Calculate complex arithmetic operational problems in few second.
### Weakness
  - Unable to perfom matrix operation. 
  - Unable to perform boolean operation.
  - Unable to perform binary operation.
  - Unable to perform trigonometric functions operation.
### Opportunities
  - It is the best programing practice to learn new things.
### Threats
  - There are show many advance calculator are already present in the market.
